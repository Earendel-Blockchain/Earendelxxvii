I am a prospective graduate of the associate’s program in Information Technology at Pennsylvania State University. In combining a rigorous academic experience with professional roles in the public and private sector, I have exemplified my keen ability to troubleshoot difficult analytical problems, collaborate on teams, and utilize my service delivery skills at a professional level. I hold great interest in remote-based opportunities concentrating on areas such as software development, along with a verifiable history of success as both a student and worker. Career focal points also include project coordination, time management, research efforts, customer care, and numerous facets of leadership excellence.
